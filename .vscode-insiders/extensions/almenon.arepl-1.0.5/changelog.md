## [v1.3](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode/milestone/13?closed=1)

### Fixed:
arepl would not start if user had no python user packages installed  https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode/issues/81

## [v9](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode/milestone/9?closed=1)

### Added:
Added telemetry (see [#50](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode/issues/51)).
This is optional and can be turned off in the settings.

Having this turned on helps me analyze how many users I have, what settings are useful to them, and how frequently they use AREPL. It also reports internal errors with AREPL backend to help diagnose bugs.

### Fixed:
Exception stacktrace used to include internal AREPL stacktrace - now the stacktrace only shows info relative to your code (see [#51](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode/issues/51))
